We present in this paper the Tidy prover, a fully automated tool for proving trace properties ofcryptographic protocols relying on quantitative values such as real time. Its specification languageis inspired by the \tidy logic, a framework for specifying security properties that rely on realnumbered mechanisms such as timeouts or timed cryptography.
We extend this idea with a generic procedure for arbitrary quantitative values (e.g., an account's balance), and provide a first prototype implementation. The tool uses an expressive specification language with a large range of convenient features for specifying protocols, including a notion of atomic composition and a ML-like static type checker.
