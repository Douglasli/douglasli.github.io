PhD researcher at [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org) focused on applied cryptography, blockchain, and privacy-preserving systems (advised by Prof. [Dario Fiore](https://www.dariofiore.it/)). Previously at [UCLA](https://cs.ucla.edu) with Prof. [Rafail Ostrovsky](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/). I work on cryptographic protocols, ZK proofs, and decentralized systems across research and industry.
