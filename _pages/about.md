I'm a PhD researcher at the IMDEA Software Institute working on applied cryptography, blockchain technologies, and privacy-preserving protocols. My journey spans academic research, industry collaborations, and open-source contributions in cryptographic protocol design, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized systems.
