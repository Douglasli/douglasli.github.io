I'm a PhD researcher at the IMDEA Software Institute working on applied cryptography, blockchain technologies, and privacy-preserving protocols. My journey spans academic research, industry collaborations, and open-source contributions in cryptographic protocol design, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized systems.

## Research Interests

- **Cryptography & Theoretical Foundations**  
  Zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-preserving protocols, STARKs, verifiable computation,  
  depth-robust graphs, and data availability structures.

- **Blockchain Systems & Security**  
  Blockchain protocols, smart contracts, consensus, multi-chain systems, and DeFi privacy.

- **Cloud Storage & Decentralized Infrastructure**  
  Secure on-chain/off-chain storage solutions for decentralized applications.
