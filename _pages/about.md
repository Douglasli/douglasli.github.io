I'm a PhD researcher at the IMDEA Software Institute working on applied cryptography, blockchain technologies, and privacy-preserving protocols. My journey spans academic research, industry collaborations, and open-source contributions in cryptographic protocol design, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized systems.

## ‚òï Hobbies

Outside of research, I enjoy:

- **Hiking** ‚Äî Exploring trails and scenic landscapes helps me reset and recharge.  
- **Tennis** ‚Äî I love the strategic and physical challenge of the sport.  
- **Coffee** ‚Äî A good espresso or pour-over sparks both conversation and contemplation.  
- **Photography** ‚Äî I document moments from everyday life and travel, often through street photography and film-style aesthetics.
